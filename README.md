# Reconstruction of angular correlations in associated top-quark and DM mediator production
This package is designed to reconstruct the neutrino and DM mediator momenta and conserve the angular correlations of the top-quark discussed in [Angular correlations in associated top-quark and dark matter production at Large Hadron Collider][1]. Several approaches are presented, which include BDT, MLP and Normalizing Flows neural networks.
